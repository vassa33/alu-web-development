# HTML ADVANCED

> In this project, I implement from scratch 
> a webpage from a designer file in my second week 
> of starting to learn about web development, 
> using HTML and CSS (yet to dive into Javascript).

*The Web-Dev journey is just beginning, but bet the results are promising, so stick around*

The Designer File containing the webpage prototype that I will be recreating is on Figma; here is the link:-
[Homepage](https://www.figma.com/file/yRdSGrt6hf1WYWIz8KV46f/Homepage?node-id=0%3A1)

We will be using the basic foundations of HTML we have learned so far, just the semantics to create the skeleton of the webpage before jumping into the 'flesh' which we will do later.

*`Duplicate to your Drafts` to have access to all design details*

With that, **Let's Begin**;  
*You gat this*
